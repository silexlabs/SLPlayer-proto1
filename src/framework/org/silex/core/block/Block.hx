/**
 * A publication in Silex is constituted of blocks.
 * The blocks represent the publication structure, 
 * each block can have children and his aware of it's
 * parent. All publications contain at least one block
 * which is called the root block, all the other block
 * being children to variying degree of this
 * root block.
 * 
 * A block is linked to the native DOM (might be Flash DOM, HTML DOM...)
 * through it's DOMObject (an abstraction of a native DOMObject,
 * might be a MovieClip/Sprite or a Div for instance). The DOMObject
 * is the skin of the Block. A block can have no DOMObject in which
 * case it is non-visual.
 * 
 * A block has a nativeClassInstance. This is the controller class
 * of the block. It is an abstraction wrapping a class instantiated
 * in a specific runtime (ActionScript, JavaScript...).
 * This class is loaded at runtime either in a library, loaded at
 * publication startup, or it can be contained in a loaded DOMObject (skin).
 * 
 * A block can have a DOMObject and no nativeClassInstance (the controller class 
 * is then assumed to be in the DOMObject), it can have only
 * a nativeClassInstance or it can have both but it can't have neither.
 * 
 * A block's 'model' is represented by it's properties and metadata, stored
 * in the BlockData structure. They are loaded at runtime from an external
 * file representing the block (might be XML, JSON...). The loaded properties
 * are pushed into the nativeClassInstance or into the DOMObject (skin) when
 * the block is initialised.
 * 
 * A block is initialised with an instance of BlockBuilder, in charge of 
 * loading/instantiating it's data file, DOMObject (skin) and native class.
 * 
 * A block is initialised when it is opened in most case, it will be displayed
 * (attach to the native display list) once loaded. It may also be preloaded,
 * for instance a block whose data file is shared with it's parent won't need
 * to load an external text file. When a block opens, it also
 * opens all of it's children whose "isAutoOpen" attribute is true. If a block
 * is transversal (if it's isTransversal attribute is true), if a block deeper
 * in the hierarchy than this block is opened, this block opens or remains open
 * even if the opened block is not one of it's direct children or in it's children "lineage"
 * (it's children of children of children...).
